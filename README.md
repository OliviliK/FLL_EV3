# FLL_EV3
This is a repository for data used in a series of blog posts at https://olliesworkshops.blogspot.com/2019/02/first-lego-league-fll-ev3-robot.html. The posts contain videos stored in YouTube with generic keywords FIRST LEGO League, FLL, EV3, and some video specific keywords.

Main components are the EV3 shared libraries with advanced MyBlocks for the three main sensors used to move a FIRST LEGO League EV3 robot in the annual competitions. These libraries are:

* **OllieBot_Encoder.ev3s** for using the encoder in the wheel motors for excact movements
* **OllieBot_Gyro.ev3s** for using the gyro sensor for excact turns
* **OllieBot_Color.ev3s** for using the color sensor for movements based on the white and black lines on the map
